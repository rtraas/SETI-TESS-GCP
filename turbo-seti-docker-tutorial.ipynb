Let's say I want to run `turbo_seti` on `h5` data of the Green Bank Telescope follow-up L-Band observations of TESS targets.  Additionally, let's say all of these `h5` files are located in `/home/raffytraas14/seti_tess/l_band/`.  Now, since I created the container in the home directory, I **should** be seeing `seti_tess` in the `ls` command.  But where is it?  It's nowhere to be found!  This is just an artifact of how Docker works, but, when you create a container, you can tell Docker to \"mount\" one your directories or files onto the container, giving the container access to those files.  That is, you can simply tell Docker to give your container access to a specific directory upon the container's creation.  This is called using a \"bind mount\"."
