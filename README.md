# turboTESS
Doppler Drift Searches for Radio Technosignatures in Breakthrough Listen's Follow-Up Observations of TESS Targets

## Project Objectives
1. Port turbo_seti (https://github.com/UCBerkeleySETI/turbo_seti) to a GCP instance
2. Use GCP to perform doppler drift searches for radio technosignatures in TESS targets

## Python Scripts
```superseti.py``` --- Used for performing turbo_seti on a batch of files
