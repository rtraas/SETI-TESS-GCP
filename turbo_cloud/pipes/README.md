# Pipes Overview
`fileio.py` --- The core module behind `autoplot.py` and `auto_find_event_pipeline.py`.  Given a one file name, `Find` will return the full, chronologically-ordered cadence it belongs to.  Includes other useful functions, as well as common recipes in the docstrings of the most useful functions.

`find_event.py` --- Used to search `turboSETI` output `.dat` files for candidate ET signals.  Also contains the function `group_events`, which creates "event groups" from output files generated by the `find_events` method.  The 125 kHz-wide clusters created by `group_events` is designed to help in finding the spacing between the highest and lowest start frequencies $\Delta\nu_{\text{event}}$ in each bin was computed.  From this value, the central frequency $\nu_{\text{event}}$ for each event group was computed.  The larger the cluster size, the greater the RFI presence (or technosignature).

`autoplot.py` --- Creates and saves 2d or 3d plots of `.csv` event files produced by `auto_find_event_pipeline.py`.

`auto_find_event_pipeline.py` --- Looks for all `.dat` files in all folders, sorts them into their corresponding cadences, and finds events within those cadences.  Uses `fileio.py` functions in order to perform this operation.

`rfspec_allocation_bands.csv` --- A `.csv` file containing RFI frequency bands which contain the highest "hit density" near the Green Bank Observatory.
